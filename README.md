# Project organisation


## Code stucture
The folders of the project are
- dbt_cinemaparadiso: the DBT project connected to BigQuery
- dev: the python project connected to BigQuery
- colab_notebooks: contains all the notebooks from the team members


## Team organisation
We followed an **Agile methodology** throughout the project, working in 5-day sprints. Daily stand-up meetings (dailies) allowed us to stay aligned, quickly address blockers, and adapt our priorities as needed. This approach helped ensure consistent progress and team collaboration.
